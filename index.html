            <p id="para-decoration">
                What can I say I love food. My journey as a chef brought me from Michigan to Oklahoma and now to
                Cailfornia. and who knows where else.The thing I love most about food is the interaction between people.
                Whether that is cooking with friends or family, teaching someone to cook, or that feeling when they try
                your food.

        <h1 class="text-center">My Recipe Secrets</h1>
        <p class="text-center">Cooking is like painting or writing a song. Just as there are only so many notes or
            colors, there are
            only so many flavors—it’s how you combine them that sets you apart.If you are a chef, no matter how good
            a chef you are, it’s not good cooking for yourself; the joy is in cooking for others.</p>
